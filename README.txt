In this project I've been working with JavaScript, HTML and CSS to create a 
website that have a bank section, a work section and a list of laptops section.
A user should be able to increase the money in the work section everytime he "works",
transfer the money in the bank section, take a loan and repay the loan. The user 
should also be able to buy a laptop of the list if he has enough money.

Most important contributions to this project was accessing data from an API, accessing
DOM Elements, creating diverse Javascript functions and eventListeners and collect
user input.


It's hosted at Github Pages.
